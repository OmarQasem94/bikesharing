The purpose of this project was utilize Tablue to create a story that depicts how the bike-sharing business model works in NYC and to demonstrate that running a similar model in Des Moines is a solid business plan. The story depicts the following:

* The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
* The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of the day of the week.
* The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
